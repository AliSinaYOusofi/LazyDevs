            <h1> 01. MacBook Pro 16-inch (M2, 2023) </h1>

            <p>
                The MacBook Pro is the most powerful and most versatile laptop ever built. It's a powerful, fast, and elegant machine. It's the perfect machine for coding, and it's the perfect machine for all your daily tasks.
            </p>

            <p> The release of the new M2 MacBook Pro 16-inch was a blessing for programmers as it combines the incredible power of the new Apple chip with a brilliantly large and bright screen (1,600 nits, if you're asking). This means no squinting at a small screen with zero compromise on power and speed, hurrah. However, if you do want a smaller screen, the M2 MacBook Pro also comes in 13-inch and 14-inch versions, both of which we love.</p>
            <p> You'll have more than enough battery to get you through the most intense coding session – this delivers an impressive 22 hours. In our review, we appreciated that there are a bunch of ports including HDMI and a memory card slot, so you can plug a second screen in directly and up your memory, too. There's also ProMotion and HDR (High Dynamic range).</p>

            <h1> 02. Razer Blade 17 (2022)  </h1>
            <p>The Razer Blade 17 is a fantastic laptop for coding on if you're working on games. Razer is a big name in PC gaming, and this laptop comes with Nvidia's latest Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU, which is extremely powerful. This allows you to work with complex 3D games that use cutting-edge tech, like ray tracing, and you'll be able to play your game afterwards to test how it runs.</p>
            <p>It's not just a gaming laptop, however, as it's built for creative professionals, and this means if you're a programmer working on heavy-duty projects, this is a laptop well worth considering. It's very expensive, but for your money you're getting some of the best mobile tech available right now. Combined with a great build quality and stunning 17-inch screen, this is a brilliant creative workstation for people who need a lot of power. Read our Razer Blade 17 review for more information.</p>

            <h1> 03. Dell Precision 5470  </h1>
            <p>The Dell Precision 5470 laptop may be smaller than others on the list, but it comes loaded with a huge amount of power for its compact frame. In fact, our testing put its performance close to that of a 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s M2 Pro chip, which is a superb laptop chip for graphic design work. Our reviewer loved it, and she is an official Apple obsessive – so that's saying something!</p>
            <p>We got over 12 hours of battery life from Dell’s Precision 5470 in our review, and the comfortable keyboard serves up an enjoyable typing experience. It’s all wrapped up in a superbly well-made chassis that feels well-built and exudes quality. So if you want portable power and are put off by some of the larger laptops on the market, Dell’s offering could be right up your street.</p>

            <h1> 04. Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022)</h1>
            <p>The Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022) offers cutting-edge components, including a 12th generation Intel processor and features an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti 4GB graphics card, which means it'll manage even the heaviest of your programming projects. </p>
            <p>The 14-core processor and 32GB of RAM also means this is an absolute beast when it comes to multitasking, which can seriously speed up your workflow. However, the most eye-catching feature of the Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022) is its dual-screen setup – there’s a 14.5-inch 120Hz OLED mains screen, which looks fantastic, and a 12.7-inch IPS display above the keyboard.</p>
            <p>The second screen is a huge positive for programmers as it frees up vital screen space. Think of it as a super-charged Touch Bar, allowing you to move apps and tools to the bottom screen, giving you more space to work with on the main one. You can also use a stylus on the second screen, turning it into a great drawing tablet. It's expensive, and the battery life isn't the best, but it's an incredible machine for working on.</p>

            <h1> 05. Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 </h1>
            <p>If you're a programmer working on Windows 10 apps in particular, then the Surface Laptop 4 could be the best laptop for you. As it's made by Microsoft, this is a brilliant showcase for Windows 10, so you can be sure your Windows apps run perfectly on the operating system. With Windows 11 now out, you can upgrade for free, and as you'd expect from a Microsoft device, the latest operating system works brilliantly on it.</p>
            <p> This model comes with a choice of 11th generation Intel Core processors, or AMD's finest mobile CPUs, as well as up to 32 GB and a speedy SSD, which makes this an excellent laptop for even most intense of programming tasks. Best of all, our testing found that it has one of the longest battery lives we've seen in a laptop, which allows you to work out and about without worrying about being plugged into a wall socket.</p>

            <h1> 06. Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022) </h1>
            <p> The Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022) is a fantastic thin and light laptop for programming on. It comes with a range of improvements over the previous model, including a new 1080p webcam and a larger, brighter screen. In fact, the MacBook Air M2 now comes in a 15-inch size, giving you even more space for programming.</p>
            <p> It also packs the new M2 chip from Apple, which is a powerful bit of silicon that makes coding on the MacBook Air a real joy. It's powerful enough to compile code in seconds, and you can run simultaneous emulations and tests at the same time.</p>
            <p>Best of all, the MacBook Air (M2, 2022)'s battery life is amazing, lasting over 16 hours in our tests. So, you can work on this throughout the day without worrying about being plugged into a power source.</p>
            <p>It's not all good news, though, as it is quite a bit more expensive than the previous model, which means it's not quite as good value for money. The 2020 model, with an M1 chip, is still a fine laptop to program on, and is still on sale. It's definitely worth checking out if the M2 model is too pricey for your budget. Find out more in our full MacBook Air (M2, 2022) review.</p>
